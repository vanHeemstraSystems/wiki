# Elf-made Millionaires: Single Point of Contact (SPOC)

The responsibilities and tasks of the Single Point of Contact (SPOC):

- Facilitate the Stand-Ups.
- Answer e-mails that are sent to us via our DL (dl-art-elfmademillionaires@acme.com).
- Coordinate incidents that are assigned to us.
- Monitor automated jobs in our domain.
- Handover SPOC duties to the next person.

General notes:

- Communicate actively that you've seen and are handling an issue.

- For all other team members:
--- Gently remind the SPOC that there is an issue that needs to be handled.
--- Help the SPOC to resolve issues:
